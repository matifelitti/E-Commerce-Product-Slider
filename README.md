# Product Slider

This is a project featuring an interactive product slider built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The slider displays a series of products, each with an image, title, description, and price. When the user clicks on the slider container, it navigates through the products, changing the view and the background color based on the current product.

## Features

- **Interactivity**: Clicking on the container moves the slider to the next product, creating a dynamic user experience.
- **Background color change**: The page background color adjusts to the color associated with each product, enhancing the visual experience.
- **Visually appealing design**: The products have an attractive and clean design with images and descriptions that provide detailed information.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure that organizes the products and the slider container.
2. **styles.css**: Defines the visual styles for the slider, products, and the overall page.
3. **script.js**: Provides the functionality to make the slider interactive and respond to user clicks.
